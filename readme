Task:
Develop Java desktop application with a small window that contains a single button and a text field. On the button click a message "Hello from <system user>, <current time>" must appear in the text field.
The application must be provisioned using Java Web Start technology (OpenWebStart) from the local http endpoint (Tomcat web server).Â 
The application must be developed on Java11+ and signed using jarsigner.

To run an app via OpenWebStart the following is required:
1. Running tomcat.
2. Execute `mvn clean package` to build the application.
3. Execute `mvn tomcat7:deploy` to deploy the application.
4. Access the app via `http://localhost:8080/MainApp/` and by clicking on the link jnlp file will be downloaded.
5. Open `MainApp.jnlp` via OpenWebStart and trust certificates, so then Desktop App is available for testing.
